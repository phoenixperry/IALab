#### Assignment due next Monday, 10/30

Please do [this tutorial](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/roll-ball-tutorial) and review the code example from class. Go through my code and comment it. What does each thing do? If you do not know, try printing any values you do not understand to the console or using them on your own objects as single commands.

From here, please create a creative world of your own. It must animate procedurally and change some combination of position, rotation and scale.

######  In the PDF

- Include your name and email

- As you work through the rollerball tutorial above, please screen cap your progress (no more than 5 total captures) and put them the document.

- Copy the code from the class with your comments into the document

- Make a small screen capture movie of your world moving. Place this movie up online and add a link to it in the document.

- Save out from whatever application you are working in as pdf and submit.
