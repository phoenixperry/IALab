# Movement is The Measure Skills Lab

Goal: To teach the fundamentals of C# and The Unity game Engine.

**Note, I have specifically augmented these tutorials so you can watch them again later on your own.**

## Arduino demo 

There's a unity project here which will expect to receive data from Arduino. This is some code I wrote to make this functional. Note, you'll need to switch the .net sdk being used to compile Unity. You will find it under Edit > Project Settings > Player > Other settings > Configuration to .net 2.0 vs the .net 2.0 subset Unity defaults to building with. You will also have to have an arduino project writing serial data out. Any sensor should work. If you want to send more than one value, my script looks for a , to split values.   

#### Assignment due next Monday, 10/30

Please do [this tutorial](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/roll-ball-tutorial) and review the code example from class. Go through my code and comment it. What does each thing do? If you do not know, try printing any values you do not understand to the console or using them on your own objects as single commands.

From here, please create a creative world of your own. It must animate procedurally and change some combination of position, rotation and scale.

######  In the PDF

- Include your name and email

- As you work through the rollerball tutorial above, please screen cap your progress (no more than 5 total captures) and put them the document.

- Copy the code from the class with your comments into the document

- Make a small screen capture movie of your world moving. Place this movie up online and add a link to it in the document.

- Save out from whatever application you are working in as pdf and submit.
